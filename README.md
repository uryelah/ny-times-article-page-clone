# NY Times page clone

This project objective is to practice HTML5 positioning with floats plus reinforcing semantic HTML best practices and layout with CSS styling, by attempting to clone a [New York Times article page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).

## Getting Started
